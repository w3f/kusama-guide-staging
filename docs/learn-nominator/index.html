You could do so as validator, which
requires a node running 24/7. If you do not have such node or do not want to bother, you can still
earn DOT by nominating one or more validators.</p><p>By doing so, you become a nominator for the validator(s) of your choice. Pick your validators
carefully - if they do not behave properly, they will get slashed and you will lose DOT as well.
However, if they do follow the rules of the network, then you can share in staking rewards that they
generate.</p><p>While your DOT are staked by nominating a validator, they are &#x27;locked&#x27; (bonded). You can receive new
DOT in your account but you cannot stake as validator or transfer DOT away from your account. You
can <a href="/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-unbond">un-nominate at any time</a> to stop staking your funds. Keep in
mind that the un-nomination is effective in the next era, and that un-nominating does not
automatically unbond your funds. There is an unbonding period of 7 days on Kusama and 28 days on
Polkadot before bonded funds can be transferred after issuing an unbond transaction.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="active-vs-inactive-nomination">Active vs. Inactive Nomination<a class="hash-link" href="#active-vs-inactive-nomination" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>When you go to the <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/staking/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Account actions</a> under staking
page, you should see your bonded accounts and nomination status. If not, you can follow
<a href="/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-nominate-polkadot">this</a> guide to configure it first. Your nominations
will be effective in the next era; eras are roughly 6 hours on Kusama and 24 hours on Polkadot.</p><p><img alt="Nominations" src="/assets/images/polkadotjs_nominator_account-e0f5d58cd9cce279d6f462cde9f706f4.png"></p><p>Suppose you have nominated five validator candidates, and three out of five were elected to the
active validator set, then you should see two of your nominations as &quot;waiting&quot;, and most likely one
as &quot;active&quot; and the rest as &quot;inactive&quot;. Active or inactive nomination means your nominated
validators have been elected to be in the validator set, whereas waiting means they did not get
elected. Generally, you will only have a single validator have an active nomination, which means
that you are directly supporting it with your stake this era and thus potentially receiving staking
rewards. Inactive nominators were validators that were elected for this era but which you are not
actively supporting. Every era, a new election will take place and you may be assigned a different
active nomination from among the validators you have selected.</p><p>If you are committing a very large amount of stake, then you may have more than one active
nomination. However, the election algorithm attempts to minimize this situation, and it should not
occur often, so you should almost always see only a single active nomination per era. See the
<a href="/docs/learn-phragmen#optimizations">section on Phragmén optimization</a> for more details.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="required-minimum-stake">Required Minimum Stake<a class="hash-link" href="#required-minimum-stake" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Due to the way the <a href="/docs/learn-phragmen">Phragmen algorithm</a> generates the solution set, and due to
the fact that the solution set must fit in a single block, in some eras, a minimum number of DOT
will be required to nominate with in order to receive staking rewards.</p><p>This parameter can be updated via on-chain governance and the most recent and up to date version can
be found on <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/chainstate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chain state</a> (select <strong>state query &gt;
staking &gt; minimumNominatorBond</strong>)</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="oversubscribed-validators">Oversubscribed Validators<a class="hash-link" href="#oversubscribed-validators" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Validators can only pay out to a certain number of nominators per era. This is currently set to
256, but can be modified via governance. If more than
256 nominators nominate the same validator, it is &quot;oversubscribed&quot;, and
only the top 256 staked nominators (ranked by amount of stake) are paid
rewards. Other nominators will receive no rewards for that era, although their stake will still be
used to calculate entry into the active validator set.</p><p>Although it is difficult to determine exactly how many nominators will nominate a given validator in
the next era, one can estimate based on the current number of nominators. A validator with only 5
nominators in this era, for instance, is unlikely to have more than 256 in
the next era. An already-oversubscribed validator with 1000 nominators this era, however, is very
likely to be oversubscribed in the next era as well.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="the-election-solution-set">The Election Solution Set<a class="hash-link" href="#the-election-solution-set" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Determining which validators are in the active set and which nominators are nominating them creates
a very large graph mapping nominators to their respective validators. This &quot;solution set&quot; is
computed off-chain and submitted to the chain, which means it must fit in a single block. If there
are a large number of nominators, this means that some nominators must be eliminated. Currently,
nominators are sorted by amount of DOT staked and those with more DOT are prioritized. This means
that if you are staking with a small amount of DOT, you may not receive rewards. This minimal amount
is dynamic based on the number of validators, number of nominators, amount nominated, and other
factors.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="receiving-rewards">Receiving Rewards<a class="hash-link" href="#receiving-rewards" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>As long as you have nominated more than one validator candidate, at least one of them got elected,
and you are nominating with enough stake to get into the solution set, your bonded stake will be
fully distributed to one or more validators. That being said, you may not receive rewards if you
nominated very few validator candidates and no one got elected, or your stake is small and you only
selected oversubscribed validators, or the validator you are nominating has 100% commission. It is
generally wise to choose as many trustworthy validators as you can (up to 16) to reduce the risk of
none of your nominated validators being elected.</p><p>Rewards are <em>lazy</em> - somebody must trigger a payout for a validator for rewards to go all of the
validator&#x27;s nominators. Any account can do this, although in practice validator operators often do
this as a service to their nominators. See the page on <a href="/docs/learn-simple-payouts">Simple Payouts</a> for
more information and instructions for claiming rewards.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="what-to-take-into-consideration-when-nominating">What to Take Into Consideration When Nominating<a class="hash-link" href="#what-to-take-into-consideration-when-nominating" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>One thing to keep in mind as a nominator is the validator&#x27;s commission. The commission is the
percentage of the validator reward which is taken by the validator before the rewards are split
among the nominators. As a nominator, you may think that the lowest commission is best. However,
this is not always true. Validators must be able to run at break-even in order to sustainably
continue operation. Independent validators that rely on the commission to cover their server costs
help to keep the network decentralized. Commission is just one piece of the puzzle that you should
consider when picking validators to nominate.</p><p><img alt="Staking Returns" src="/assets/images/polkadotjs_nominators_target-4b6618ad6611abdfa95dfd08551ac4d2.png"></p><p>As a nominator, if you only want to know the profit each validator made for each era, you can go to
the <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/staking/targets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Targets</a> section under the staking page by
inputting the number of tokens you would like to stake to check it. Then, nominate those who have a
higher profit. However, that does not guarantee the right way to evaluate the validators&#x27; overall
performance.</p><p>It is worth taking into consideration &quot;own stake&quot; of a validator. This refers to the quantity of DOT
the validator has put up at stake themselves. A higher &quot;own stake&quot; amount can be considered
as having more &quot;skin in the game&quot;. This can imply increased trustworthiness. However, a validator not
having a large amount of &quot;own stake&quot; is not automatically untrustworthy, as the validator could be
nominating from a different address.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="filter-out-validators-with-undesirable-traits">Filter Out Validators With Undesirable Traits<a class="hash-link" href="#filter-out-validators-with-undesirable-traits" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>On the Targets page, you can filter out validators that have traits that may indicate an issue with
you nominating them. You can turn these filters off and on to help narrow down which validators you
should nominate. It is important to note that none of these traits are necessarily &quot;bad&quot;; however,
depending on your validator selection methodology, they may be characteristics that you would be
interested in filtering out.</p><ul><li><strong>Single from operator</strong> - Do not show groups of validators run by a single operator.</li><li><strong>No 20%+ comm</strong> - Do not show any validators with a commission of 20% or higher.</li><li><strong>No at capacity</strong> - Do not show any validators who are currently operating
<a href="/docs/glossary#capacity">at capacity</a> (i.e., could potentially be oversubscribed).</li><li><strong>Recent payouts</strong> - Only show validators that have recently caused a
<a href="/docs/learn-simple-payouts">payout to be issued</a>. Note that anyone can cause a payout to occur; it
does not have to be the operator of a validator.</li><li><strong>Only elected</strong> - Only show validators that are currently in the active set (i.e., they have been
elected to produce blocks this era).</li><li><strong>Only with an identity</strong> - Only show validators that have set an <a href="/docs/learn-identity">identity</a>.
Note that this identity does not have to be verified by a registrar for the validator to show up
in the list.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="review-your-validators-history">Review Your Validators&#x27; History<a class="hash-link" href="#review-your-validators-history" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>How the validator acted in the past may be a good indicator of how they will act in the future. An
example of problematic behavior would be if a validator is regularly offline, their nominators most
likely would get fewer rewards than others. More importantly, when many validators are
<a href="/docs/learn-staking#unresponsiveness">unreachable</a>, those nominators who staked with them will be
slashed.</p><p><img alt="Validator Stats" src="/assets/images/polkadotjs_validator_stats-4b433d0c856a8bf0d2bb53cea027e009.png"></p><p>Thus, to be a smart nominator, it would be better to query their
<a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/staking/query/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">histories</a> to see statistics such as blocks
produced, rewards and slashes, and <a href="/docs/learn-identity">identity</a> (if they have it set). Moreover, a
nominator should do comprehensive research on their validator candidates - they should go over the
validators&#x27; websites to see who they are, what kind of infrastructure setup they are using,
reputation, the vision behind the validator, and more.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="be-aware-of-the-risks-of-single-operators-with-multiple-validators">Be Aware of The Risks of Single Operators with Multiple Validators<a class="hash-link" href="#be-aware-of-the-risks-of-single-operators-with-multiple-validators" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Recall that slashing is an additive function; the more validators that are offline or equivocate in
a given session, the harsher the penalties. Since validators that are controlled by a single entity
are more at risk of a &quot;synchronized&quot; failure, nominating them implies a greater risk of having a
large slash of your nominated funds. Generally, it is safer to nominate validators whose behavior is
independent from others in as many ways as possible (different hardware, geographic location, owner,
etc.).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="avoiding-oversubscribed-validators">Avoiding Oversubscribed Validators<a class="hash-link" href="#avoiding-oversubscribed-validators" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>If you are not nominating with a large number of DOTs, you should try to avoid
<a href="/docs/glossary#oversubscribed">oversubscribed</a> validators. It is not always easy to calculate if the
validator selected will be oversubscribed in the next session; one way to avoid choosing potentially
oversubscribed validators is to filter out any that are <a href="/docs/glossary#capacity">at capacity</a> on the
Targets page.</p><p>Finally, if you have a very small amount of DOTs, you may not be able to have your nomination fit
into the election set. The nominator to validator mapping has to fit in a single block, and if there
are too many nominators, the lowest-staked nominations will be dropped. This value is obviously
dynamic and will vary over time. If you review the lowest amount of nominations that are occurring
on current validators, you can get a good idea of how many DOTs will likely be necessary to have
your nomination earn you rewards. You can read the blog post
