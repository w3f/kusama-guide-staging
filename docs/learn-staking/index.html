how it works on
Kusama.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a class="hash-link" href="#introduction" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Blockchain networks use <a href="/docs/learn-consensus/#why-do-we-need-consensus">consensus</a> mechanisms to finalize
blocks on the chain. Consensus is the process of agreeing on something, in this case, the progression
of the blockchain or how blocks are added to the chain. Consensus consists of two actions:</p><ul><li><code>block production</code>, i.e. the way multiple blocks candidates are produced, and </li><li><code>block finality</code>, i.e. the way only one block out of many candidates is selected and added to the canonical chain (see <a href="/docs/learn-consensus/#probabilistic-vs-provable-finality">this</a> article for more information about finality).</li></ul><p>Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) are well-known mechanisms used to reach consensus in a secure and trustless way on public blockchains, where we have many participants who do not know each other (and probably never will). In PoW networks, miners are responsible for adding blocks to the chain, and for doing such work they are
typically rewarded with tokens. Network security relies on the fact that the miners must compete to solve difficult mathematic puzzles to add blocks - a solution that has been criticized for energy wastage. In PoS networks like Kusama the
security of the network depends on the amount of capital locked on chain: the more the capital
locked the lower the chance of an attack on the network, as the attacker
needs to incur a heavy loss to orchestrate a successful attack (more on this later on). The process of
locking tokens on chain is called <code>staking</code>. </p><p>Similar to the miners in PoW networks, PoS networks have <code>validators</code> but they do not have to compete with each other to solve mathematical puzzles and are instead pre-selected to produce the blocks based on the stake backing them.
Token holders can lock funds on chain and for doing so, they are getting <code>staking rewards</code>. There is
thus an economic incentive for token holders to become active participants who contribute to the
security and economic stability of the network. PoS networks in general are therefore more inclusive
than PoW networks, as participants do not need to have either technical knowledge about
blockchain technology or experience in running mining equipment. </p><p>PoS ensures that everybody participating in the staking process has
&quot;skin in the game&quot; and thus can be held accountable. In case of misbehavior participants in the
staking process can be punished or <code>slashed</code>, and depending on the gravity of the situation, their
stake can be partly or fully confiscated by the network. It is not in a staker&#x27;s economic interest to orchestrate an attack and risk losing tokens. Any rational actor staking on the network would want to get rewarded, and the PoS network rewards good behavior and punishes bad behavior.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="nominated-proof-of-stake-overview">Nominated Proof-of-stake overview<a class="hash-link" href="#nominated-proof-of-stake-overview" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Kusama implements NPoS (Nominated Proof-of-Stake),
a relatively novel and sophisticated mechanism to select the validators who are allowed to participate in
its <a href="/docs/learn-consensus">consensus</a> protocol. The NPoS encourages KSM
holders to participate as nominators.</p><p><a href="/docs/learn-consensus/#nominated-proof-of-stake">Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS)</a> encourages KSM
holders to participate as <code>nominators</code>. Nominators may back up to

validators as trusted validator candidates, and the network will automatically distribute the stake among validators in
an even manner. Also, in NPoS the stake of both nominators and validators can be slashed.  For an in-depth review of NPoS check

bonding tokens (stake) on chain, and 2) nominating a set of validator candidates to whom the stake will
be allocated. Kusama uses tools ranging
from election theory to game theory to discrete optimization, to develop an efficient validator
selection process that offers fair representation and security, thus avoiding uneven power and
influence among validators. The election algorithms used by Kusama are based on the Proportional Justified Representation (PJR) methods like <a href="/docs/learn-phragmen">Phragmen</a>. For more information about PJR methods visit <a href="https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/NPoS/1.%20Overview.html?highlight=proportional%20justified%20representation#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> research article.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="eras-and-sessions">Eras and sessions<a class="hash-link" href="#eras-and-sessions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The stake from nominators is used to increase the number of tokens held by such candidates, increasing their chance of being selected by the election algorithm for block
production during a specific <code>era</code>. An era is a period of time of 6 hours during
which an <code>active set</code> of validators is producing blocks and performing other actions on chain. This
means that not all validators are in the active set and such set changes between eras. Each era is
divided into 6 epochs or <code>sessions</code> during which validators are assigned as block producers to
specific time frames or <code>slots</code>. This means that validators know the slots when they will be
required to produce a block within a specific session, but they do not know all the slots within a
specific era. Having sessions adds a layer of security because it decreases the chance of having
multiple validators assigned to a slot colluding to harm the network.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rewards">Rewards<a class="hash-link" href="#rewards" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Validators who produce a block are rewarded with tokens, and they can share rewards with their
nominators. Both validators and nominators can stake their tokens on chain and receive staking
rewards at the end of each era. The staking system pays out rewards equally to all validators
regardless of stake. Thus, having more stake in a validator does not influence the amount of block rewards
it receives. This avoids the centralization of power to a few validators. There is a probabilistic
component in the calculation of rewards, so they may not be exactly equal for all validators. In
fact, during each era validators can earn <code>era points</code> by doing different tasks on chain. The more the points, the higher the reward for a specific era. This promotes validators&#x27; activity on chain.
To know more about era points, and how and on which basis they are distributed visit the
<a href="/docs/maintain-guides-validator-payout">dedicated page</a>. Distribution of the rewards is pro-rata to all stakers after the validator&#x27;s commission is deducted.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="skin-in-the-game-when-staking">Skin in the game when Staking<a class="hash-link" href="#skin-in-the-game-when-staking" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The security of PoS networks depends on the amount of staked tokens. This means
that to successfully attack the network one would need a large number of tokens that can be accrued
by one single participant alone or would need different participants to collude and act maliciously. In the case of NPoS, if there is an attack both the validator(s) and nominators will be
<code>slashed</code> and in some cases, their stake partially or fully confiscated by the network and deposited in the treasury. So there is little interest in acting in a harmful way because all participants can be
held accountable for bad actions. In NPoS, validators are paid equal rewards regardless of the amount they have at stake, thus avoiding large payouts to few large validators which would
ultimately lead to consensus centralization.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="being-a-nominator">Being a nominator<a class="hash-link" href="#being-a-nominator" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tasks-and-responsibilities">Tasks and responsibilities<a class="hash-link" href="#tasks-and-responsibilities" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Since validator slots are limited, most of those who wish to stake their DOT and contribute to the
economic security of the network will be nominators, thus here we focus on the role of nominators.
However, it is worth mentioning that validators do most of the heavy lifting: they run the validator nodes and manage

to become a validator check <a href="/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot">this</a> guide.</p><p>Nominators have far fewer responsibilities than validators. These include selecting validators and
monitoring their performance, keeping an eye on changing commission rates (a validator can change
commission at any time), and general health monitoring of their validators&#x27; accounts. Thus, while not
being completely set-it-and-forget-it, a nominator&#x27;s experience is relatively hands-off compared to that of
a validator. For more information, you can take a look at the <a href="/docs/learn-nominator">nominator guide</a>

risk preferences. Ideally one aims to maximize the reward-to-risk ratio by maximizing rewards and minimizing risks, with sometimes having to
compromise between the two as minimizing risks might decrease rewards as well. Nominators should pay attention, especially to six criteria when nominating validators (not in order of importance):</p><ul><li>recent history of the era points earned across eras</li><li>validator&#x27;s self stake (shows skin in the game)</li><li>total stake backing the validator (which is the sum of self stake and the stake coming from nominators)</li><li>commission fees (i.e. how much validators charge nominators)</li><li>verified identity</li><li>previous slashes</li></ul><p>The diagram below shows how the selection of those criteria affects the reward-to-risk ratio.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="rewards and risks diagram" src="/assets/images/Reward-risk nominating-2a0d217ac3cfa76b65af0c1b09e754f1.png" width="845" height="421" class="img_ev3q"></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="in-theory">In theory<a class="hash-link" href="#in-theory" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>To maximize rewards and minimize risk, one could select those validators
that:</p><ul><li>have era points above average (because they will get more rewards for being active), </li><li>have the total stake backing the validator below the average active validator stake (because they will pay out more rewards per staked KSM), </li><li>have high own stake (because if slashed they have a lot to lose), </li><li>have low commission fees but not 0% (because it makes sense that for doing the heavy lifting, validators ask for a small commission), </li><li>have on-chain registered identity (because it adds a layer of trust and possibly provides access to their website and contact details), </li><li>and have not been slashed (meaning that their on-chain behavior is genuine).</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="in-practice">In practice<a class="hash-link" href="#in-practice" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-caution alert alert--warning admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M8.893 1.5c-.183-.31-.52-.5-.887-.5s-.703.19-.886.5L.138 13.499a.98.98 0 0 0 0 1.001c.193.31.53.501.886.501h13.964c.367 0 .704-.19.877-.5a1.03 1.03 0 0 0 .01-1.002L8.893 1.5zm.133 11.497H6.987v-2.003h2.039v2.003zm0-3.004H6.987V5.987h2.039v4.006z"></path></svg></span>Nominators must periodically check their validators</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>Nominating is <em>not</em> a &quot;set and forget&quot; operation.

result in applied slashes and/or rewards not being paid out, possibly for a prolonged period of time.</p></div></div><p>Although the theory can be used as a general guideline, in practice it is more complicated and
following the theory might not necessarily lead to the desired result. Validators might have the total stake backing them below average, low commission and above average era points in one era and then have a totally
different profile in the next one. Selection based the criteria like on-chain identity, slash history and low commission make the staking rewards deterministic. But there are criteria that vary more than others, with era points
being the most variable and thus one of the key probabilistic components of staking rewards. It is not recommended
to change nominations because of the low era points of a validator in a single era. Variability in rewards due to the era points should level out over time. If a validator consistently gets

<a href="https://substrate.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">substrate</a>, a modular system to efficiently build blockchains without having necessarily deep knowledge about blockchain technology. Within each module or <code>pallet</code>, one can <code>call</code> different
functions that have similar logic. For example, the staking pallet contains all functionalities
related to staking such as bonding or unbonding funds. The combined information of pallets and calls
constitutes an <code>extrinsic</code>, i.e. a transaction that is executed from outside the chain but that
triggers an event within the chain. Continuing with the staking example, within the staking pallet
one can bond funds and nominate some validators. The signature of such
extrinsic might trigger a reward payout at the end of an era; this is an event inside the chain. This way of having
transactions categorized within pallets and functionalities makes it possible to create accounts
having special permissions also called <strong>proxy accounts</strong>.</p><p>In Kusama proxy accounts are special
accounts to which one can delegate signatures to calls from specific pallets. There is thus the
possibility to create staking proxy accounts that can be used to sign only calls from staking,
session and utility pallets. This makes the stash account even more isolated than using a controller
account since now one can bond / unbond / bond more funds using the staking proxy account. However,
it is important to remember that actions on proxy accounts are limited, and in the case of staking
proxy accounts, calls from the balance pallet cannot be signed. This means that it is not possible to
send funds from a staking proxy. To do that one needs to remove that account as a staking proxy.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="staking-system-overview">Staking system overview<a class="hash-link" href="#staking-system-overview" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Any potential validators can indicate their intention to be a validator candidate.

<a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/9507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bags-list</a>.
The bags list example below uses DOT for explaining the concepts.The bags list
has two primary components, bags and nodes. The list is composed of bags that each describe a range
of active bonded funds (e.g. the 1st bag will have nominators who staked 0 → 10 DOT, 2nd bag 11 → 20
DOT, etc). Each bag contains nodes that correspond to nominators and their staked funds.</p><p>The bags-list pallet is designed to be self-maintaining, with minimal effort from the blockchain,
making it extremely scalable. Let us explore the sorting functionality of the bags list with an
example. In the bags list below, there are 8 nodes (corresponding to 8 accounts with staked funds)
placed in 3 bags. It can be observed that the list of nodes within the bags is arranged based on
their insertion order and not based on the number of tokens bonded. For instance, the nodes in bag 1
are arranged in this order: 15 → 12 → 19.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="bags list example 1" src="/assets/images/bags-list-example-1-2a3130b15af9da6b8d758a8f64f46db1.png" width="1994" height="578" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Let&#x27;s say the nominator with the stake of 19 DOT bonds 2 DOT additionally. This action would place
that nominator node in bag 2, right after the node with 27 DOT.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="bags list example 2" src="/assets/images/bags-list-example-2-fbeb87ba5de9597dd425d8c12e45c9d7.png" width="1994" height="578" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Once the nomination period ends, the NPoS election mechanism takes the nomination intents and their
associated votes as input, and it outputs a set of validators. The bags are iterated from the most
staked to the least staked. This could leave the last touched bag to only be partially iterated.
This means that in some edge cases, the order of members within a bag is also important. Recall that
within each bag, the iteration order is simply the insertion order. If only 7 nodes must be picked
for the electing set, the nodes with 5 and 7 DOT will be selected while the node with 8 DOT will be
left out.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="bags list example 3" src="/assets/images/bags-list-example-3-de0feba4f8f41877ed9a9427b2e51b13.png" width="1994" height="578" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>If one receives staking rewards and the amount of staked tokens within the stash account increases
over time, the position within a bag changes and may also result in a change of bag. This may also
happen if accounts within the bag bond more tokens or unbond tokens, one&#x27;s account position and the
position of other accounts in the bags list might change. These changes are not done automatically.
The <code>voterList</code> pallet comes with the extrinsic <code>putInFrontOf</code> which helps the node to move up in the
bag. Also, the pallet comes with an important permissionless extrinsic: <code>rebag</code>. This
allows anyone to specify another account that is in the wrong bag, and place it in the correct one.
Actions like bonding/unbonding tokens automatically rebags the nominator node, but events like
staking rewards/slashing do not. Check the <a href="/docs/learn-nominator#bags-list">bags-list</a> section for
more information.</p><p>This sorting functionality using bags is extremely important for the
<a href="https://gist.github.com/kianenigma/aa835946455b9a3f167821b9d05ba376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long-term improvements</a> of the
staking/election system. The bags-list is capable of including an unlimited number of nodes, subject
to the chain&#x27;s runtime storage. In the current staking system configuration, the bags list keeps

the same amount of tokens for equal work, i.e. they are not paid proportional to the stakes in
each pool. There is a probabilistic component to staking rewards in the form of
<a href="/docs/maintain-guides-validator-payout##era-points">era points</a> and
<a href="/docs/learn-transaction-fees#fee-calculation">tips</a> but these should average out over time.</p></div></div><p>Validator pools are paid the same regardless of stake level. Pools with less stake will generally pay more to nominators
per-token than pools with more stake. This gives nominators an economic incentive to gradually shift their preferences to lower-staked validators that gain a sufficient amount of reputation. A consequence of this is that the stake across validator pools will be as evenly distributed as possible, to avoid a concentration of power among a few validators. In the long term, validator pools will have similar levels of stake, with the stake
being higher for higher reputation validators (meaning that a nominator that is willing to risk more
by backing a validator with a low reputation will get paid more).</p><p>Before distributing rewards to nominators, validators can create a cut of the reward (a commission) that is not shared with the nominators.
This cut is a percentage of the block reward, not an absolute value. After the commission gets
deducted, the remaining portion is based on their staked value and split between the validator and
all of the nominators who have voted for this validator.</p><p>For example, assume the block reward for a validator is 10 DOT. A validator may specify
<code>validator_commission = 50%</code>, in which case the validator would receive 5 DOT. The remaining 5 DOT
would then be split between the validator and their nominators based on the proportion of stake each
nominator had. Note that validators can put up their own stake, and for this calculation, their
stake acts just as if they were another nominator.</p><p>Within a validator pool, a percentage of the reward goes thus to pay the validator&#x27;s
commission fees and the remainder is paid pro-rata (i.e. proportional to stake) to the
nominators and validator. If a validator&#x27;s commission is set to 100%, no tokens will be paid out to any
nominations in the validator pool. Notice in particular that the validator is rewarded twice: once in
commission fees for validating (if their commission rate is above 0%), and once for nominating
itself with own stake.</p><p>The following example should clarify the above. For simplicity, we have the following assumptions:</p><ul><li>These validators do not have a stake of their own.</li><li>They each receive the same number of era points.</li><li>There are no tips for any transactions processed.</li><li>They do NOT charge any commission fees.</li><li>Total reward amount is 100 DOT tokens.</li><li>The current minimum amount of DOT to be a validator is 350 (note that this is <em>not</em> the actual
value, which fluctuates, but merely an assumption for purposes of this example; to understand how
the actual minimal stake is calculated, see

validator, you can use this <a href="https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/polkadot/calculate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tool</a> as a
reference and play around with it by changing some parameters (e.g. how many days you would like to
stake with your DOT, provider fees, compound rewards, etc.) to have a better estimate. Even though
it may not be entirely accurate since staking participation is changing dynamically, it works well
as an indicator.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="oversubscription-commission-fees--slashes">Oversubscription, commission fees &amp; slashes<a class="hash-link" href="#oversubscription-commission-fees--slashes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>There is an additional factor to consider in terms of rewards. While there is no limit to the number
of nominators a validator may have, a validator does have a limit to how many nominators to which it
can pay rewards. In Kusama this limit is currently <!-- -->, although this can be
modified via runtime upgrade. A validator with more than <!-- --> nominators is
<em>oversubscribed</em>. When payouts occur, only the top <!-- --> nominators as measured by the amount of stake allocated to that validator will receive rewards. All other nominators
are essentially &quot;wasting&quot; their stake - they used their nomination to elect that validator to the
active stake, but receive no rewards in exchange for doing so.</p><p>Note that the network slashes a validator slot for a misbehavior (e.g. validator
offline, equivocation, etc.) the slashed amount is a fixed percentage (and not a fixed amount),
which means that validator pools with more stake get slashed more DOT. Again, this is done to
provide nominators with an economic incentive to shift their preferences and back less popular
validators whom they consider to be trustworthy.</p><p>Also note that each validator candidate is free to name their desired commission
fee (as a percentage of rewards) to cover operational costs. Since validator pools are paid the
same, pools with lower commission fees pay more to nominators than pools with higher fees. Thus,
each validator can choose between increasing their fees to earn more, or decreasing their fees to
attract more nominators and increase their chances of being elected. In the long term, we expect
that all validators will need to be cost-efficient to remain competitive, and that validators with
higher reputation will be able to charge slightly higher commission fees (which is fair).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="claiming-rewards">Claiming rewards<a class="hash-link" href="#claiming-rewards" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Note that Kusama runs approximately 4x as fast as Polkadot, except for block production times.
Polkadot will also produce blocks at approximately six-second intervals.</p><p>Rewards are recorded per session (approximately one hour) and
calculated per era (approximately 6 hours). Thus,
rewards will be calculated 4 times per day. Rewards are calculated based on era points, which have a probabilistic component. In other words,
there may be slight differences in your rewards from era to era, and even amongst validators in the
active set at the same time. These variations should cancel out over a long enough timeline. See the
page on <a href="/docs/maintain-guides-validator-payout">Validator Payout Guide</a>.</p><p>In order to be paid your staking rewards, someone must claim them for each validator that you

<a href="https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000168954-how-can-i-see-my-staking-rewards-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the relevant Support page</a>
for details.</p><p>For specific details about validator payouts, please see
<a href="/docs/maintain-guides-validator-payout">this guide</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="slashing">Slashing<a class="hash-link" href="#slashing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Slashing will happen if a validator misbehaves (e.g. goes offline, attacks the network, or runs
modified software) in the network. They and their nominators will get slashed by losing a percentage
of their bonded/staked DOT.</p><p>Any slashed DOT will be added to the <a href="/docs/learn-treasury">Treasury</a>. The rationale for this (rather
than burning or distributing them as rewards) is that slashes may then be reverted by the Council by
simply paying out from the Treasury. This would be useful in situations such as faulty slashes. In the case of
legitimate slashing, it moves tokens away from malicious validators to those building the ecosystem
through the normal Treasury process.</p><p>Validator pools with a larger total stake backing them will get slashed more harshly than less popular
ones, so we encourage nominators to shift their nominations to less popular validators to reduce
their possible losses.</p><p>It is important to realize that slashing only occurs for active validations for a given nominator,
and slashes are not mitigated by having other inactive or waiting nominations. They are also not
mitigated by the validator operator running separate validators; each validator is considered its
own entity for purposes of slashing, just as they are for staking rewards.</p><p>In rare instances, a nominator may be actively nominating several validators in a single era. In
this case, the slash is proportionate to the amount staked to that specific validator. Note that you cannot control the percentage of stake you have allocated
to each validator or choose who your active validator will be (except in the trivial case of
nominating a single validator). Staking allocations are controlled by the
<a href="/docs/learn-phragmen">Phragmén algorithm</a>.</p><p>Once a validator gets slashed, it goes into the state as an &quot;unapplied slash&quot;. You can check this
via
<a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.polkadot.io#/staking/slashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polkadot-JS Apps</a>.
The UI shows it per validator and then all the affected nominators along with the amounts. While
unapplied, a governance proposal can be made to reverse it during this period (7 days on Kusama, 28
days on Polkadot). After the grace period, the slashes are applied.</p><p>The following levels of offense are
<a href="https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/slashing/amounts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">defined</a>. However, these
particular levels are not implemented or referred to in the code or in the system; they are meant as
guidelines for different levels of severity for offenses. To understand how slash amounts are
calculated, see the equations in the section below.</p><ul><li>Level 1: isolated unresponsiveness, i.e. being offline for an entire session. Generally no
slashing, only <a href="#chilling"><em>chilling</em></a>.</li><li>Level 2: concurrent unresponsiveness or isolated equivocation, slashes a very small amount of the
stake and chills.</li><li>Level 3: misconducts unlikely to be accidental, but which do not harm the network&#x27;s security to
any large extent. Examples include concurrent equivocation or isolated cases of unjustified voting
in <a href="/docs/learn-consensus">GRANDPA</a>. Slashes a moderately small amount of the stake and chills.</li><li>Level 4: misconduct that poses serious security or monetary risk to the system, or mass
collusion. Slashes all or most of the stake behind the validator and chills.</li></ul><p>For more information about slashing visit the dedicated page.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="chilling">Chilling<a class="hash-link" href="#chilling" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Chilling is the act of stepping back from any nominating or validating. It can be done by a
validator or nominator at any time, taking effect in the next era. It can also
specifically mean removing a validator from the active validator set by another validator,
disqualifying them from the set of electable candidates in the next NPoS cycle.</p><p>Chilling may be voluntary and validator-initiated, e.g. if there is a planned outage in the
validator&#x27;s surroundings or hosting provider, and the validator wants to exit to protect themselves
against slashing. When voluntary, chilling will keep the validator active in the current session,
but will move them to the inactive set in the next. The validator will not lose their nominators.</p><p>When used as part of a punishment (initiated externally), being chilled carries an implied penalty
of being un-nominated. It also disables the validator for the remainder of the current era and
removes the offending validator from the next election.</p><p>Polkadot allows some validators to be disabled, but if the number of disabled validators gets too
large, Polkadot will trigger a new validator election to get a full set. Disabled validators will
need to resubmit their intention to validate and re-garner support from nominators.</p><p>For more on chilling, see the <a href="/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-chill">How to Chill</a> page on this wiki.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="inflation">Inflation<a class="hash-link" href="#inflation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p></p><p>KSM is inflationary; there is no maximum number of KSM. Inflation is designed
to be approximately 10% annually, with validator rewards being a function of the amount staked
and the remainder going to the treasury. The current token supply of KSM is ~10,000,000.</p><p>There is an <em>ideal staking rate</em> that the network tries to maintain. The goal is to have the <em>system
staking rate</em> meet the <em>ideal staking rate</em>.</p><p>The system staking rate would be the total amount staked over the total token supply, where the
total amount staked is the stake of all validators and nominators on the network. The ideal staking
rate accounts for having sufficient backing of
KSM to prevent the possible compromise of security while keeping the native
token liquid. An <strong>ideal staking rate of 50% stabilizes the network</strong>.
KSM is inflated according to the system staking
rate of the entire network.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>According to the inflation model, this would suggest that if you do not use your

validators/nominators if 50% of all KSM / DOT are staked. Any deviation from the 50% - positive or

nominal return rate will be higher, encouraging more users to use their tokens for staking. On the
