By making each period a 6-week duration but the overall slot a 1-year\nduration, the mechanism can cope with well-funded parachains that will ensure they secure\na slot at the end of their lease, while gradually allowing other parachains to enter the ecosystem\nto occupy the durations that are not filled. For example, if a large, well-funded parachain has\nalready acquired a slot for range 1 - 8, they would be very interested in getting the next slot that\nwould open for 2 - 9.
